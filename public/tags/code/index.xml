      <description>Recently I wanted to reverse engineer an application that uses websockets to communicate with with its server. I wanted to see the data that was being sent and received. I used mitmproxy to intercept the traffic and view it in plain text.&#xA;WebSocket traffic operates over TCP, initially using HTTP for handshake (usually port 80 for unencrypted or 443 for encrypted connections). After the handshake, it establishes a persistent, full-duplex communication channel over the same TCP connection.</description>
