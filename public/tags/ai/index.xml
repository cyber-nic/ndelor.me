      <description>Breathing New Life into Traditional Quebecois Songs with AI In late 2024, I stumbled upon a delightful book titled Chansons du Vieux Québec at the Last Bookshop Jericho in Oxford. Published in 1946, this book is a treasure trove of traditional Quebecois songs, complete with music scores. The idea of using AI to revive these songs struck me as a fascinating project.
The complete outcome of this project can be found ndelor.</description>

      <description>I have 2,000,000 images which all containt a watermark pattern. This post will explore options for removing the watermarks in order to improve the quality of the OCR operations to follow.
1) Skipping Watermark Removal The cheapest option in terms of time and resources is to skip watermark removal altogether. This can be done by filtering out the known watermark text from the OCR results. This is the best short-term solution, as it is relatively easy to implement and does not require any additional software.</description>

      <description>Target The target site is completely free and public. While the site&amp;rsquo;s performance is sufficient it unfortunately isn&amp;rsquo;t well maintained: SSL cert is expired. Luckily the sought after information is available directly via REST calls. No html parsing necessary.
Process The scraping process was performed on a Cloud Compute, Regular Performance, $5/month VM on Vultr.com. The attached 120GB block storage was quickly expanded to 500GB, which increased the cost from $3.</description>

      <description>Assumptions / Constraints We will operate on a dataset of ~2,000,000 jpeg images / ~500GB The initial budget is $1000. It is expected that this will increase, but the goal is to re-evaluate the budget prior to spending. We will operate using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) but might explore other cloud offerings when performance or cost become a concern System Design Scraping I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented scrapers using various languages including PowerShell, Node.</description>
