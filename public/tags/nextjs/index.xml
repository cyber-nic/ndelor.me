      <description>In 2022, I launched www.4ks.io, a recipe editing and forking website. I used React and ViteJS v2 for the front-end and was really impressed with its performance, particularly its quick Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics.&#xA;Recently, I began exploring NextJS, initially with version 13 and then upgrading to Next 14, to integrate server-side rendering (SSR) for better SEO and providing better i18n tooling. The performance with NextJS was on par with ViteJS, but I ran into some challenges, such as duplicate API calls during SSR.</description>
